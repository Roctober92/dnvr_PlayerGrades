<p id="desc">I think looking through data is always fun. I've been wanting to do a light analysis on the DNVR player grades for a while.<br><br>There may be nothing here in terms of useful information, but there were a few questions and ideas I wanted to ask and explore.</p>

<p id="portada">A Little Note About the Data:</p>
<br><br>

<p id="desc">Since a lot of this was messy, manual data input, there are prone to exists typos and errors: I did my best to validate myself, but it was a lot of data input.<br><br>Also, there are about 5 games that I, or DNVR, omitted from the data. 3 were missing from DNVR's grades section, and for the last 2 games of each playoff series, DNVR decided to do <i>series grades</i> instead of that specific game. And to maintain consistency, I did not include them.</p>
